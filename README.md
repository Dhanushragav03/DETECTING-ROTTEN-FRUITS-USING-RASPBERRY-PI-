# Rotten Fruit Detection Using Raspberry Pi

This project aims to utilize Raspberry Pi for the detection of rotten fruits using computer vision techniques. By leveraging the capabilities of Raspberry Pi along with image processing algorithms, we can create an affordable and efficient solution for identifying and sorting out rotten fruits in real time.

## Key Components

1. Raspberry Pi Setup
Hardware: Raspberry Pi board (e.g., Raspberry Pi 3/4), Camera Module.
Software: Raspbian OS, Python libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow, etc.).
2. Image Acquisition
Utilize Raspberry Pi's camera module to capture images of fruits.
3. Image Processing
Implement algorithms to process captured images for detecting signs of rot, such as discoloration, mold, or texture irregularities.
Techniques may include color thresholding, edge detection, and machine learning-based classification.
4. Machine Learning Integration
Train machine learning models on labeled datasets to enhance the accuracy of fruit classification.
Techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be employed for this purpose.
5. GPIO Control
Utilize Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins for interfacing with external hardware, such as actuators or displays, for real-time alerts or sorting instructions.
